**Key Features**
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed irrelevant features, and performed one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

Regression Models:
Linear Regression: Baseline model for price prediction.
Ridge Regression: Used for regularization to reduce overfitting, with hyperparameter tuning for alpha.
Lasso Regression: Implemented to perform feature selection by shrinking coefficients.

Model Evaluation:
Metrics: RÂ², Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Comparison of training and testing scores to evaluate overfitting or underfitting.
Dataset: Features include property details like distance, bedroom count, bathroom count, car spaces, land size, and building area.

**Tools and Libraries**
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and metrics.
